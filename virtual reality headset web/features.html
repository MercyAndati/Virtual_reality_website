            <img src="vrH\detail-mic.webp" alt="Feature 1">
            <h3>Stereo Microphones</h3>
            <p>Voice is one of the most important elements in a VR headset. Beyond has an array of studio-grade microphones with high-end components and membranes that provide astounding sound quality. This provides high-fidelity audio without plosives, compression, or artifacts in multiplayer games and social VR.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
            <img src="vrH\detail-proximity.webp" alt="Feature 2">
            <h3>Proximity Sensor</h3>
            <p>Beyond features a tiny proximity sensor near the nose. This sensor detects when the headset is being worn. When not worn, the displays automatically turn off, preventing screen burn-in and prolonging the life of the headset.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
            <img src="vrH\detail-cable.webp" alt="Feature 3">
            <h3>5m Fiber Optic Cable</h3>
            <p>The headset is powered by a custom, ultra-lightweight 5-meter fiber optic cable that connects to the USB-C port on the left side of the headset. The cable is easy to remove or replace. The cable connects the headset to a Link Box. The Link Box has a DisplayPort cable and two USB 3.0 cables, which connect to the PC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
            <img src="vrH\detail-extra.webp" alt="Feature 4">
            <h3>USB-C Accessory Port</h3>
            <p>The USB-C port on the right side of the headset connects to Beyond's Audio Strap or other 3rd-party accessories such as USB-C to 3.5mm audio jack adapters and headphones. The port provides power and USB 2.0 data speeds to accessories, and is capable of driving high-end high-impedance headphones.</p>
